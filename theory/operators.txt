Operators :- operators are use to perform operations on values or varibales
1 + 2

+ = it nothing but operators
1 and 2 this are the operands

different types of operators
1. Arithmetic Operator :- it perform the mathematical operations/calculations
   addition +
   multification *
   substraction -
   division /
   modulus %
   exponentialtion **

2. Comparison Operator :- its use to compare two or more values or variables
   equla to ==
   identical ===
   not equal to !=
   not identical !==
   greater tah >
   less than <
   greater than equal to >=
   less than equal to <= 

3. Logical Operator :- Logical operators are use to compare two conditions and
logical operator always associate with comparison operator
 
    and &&
    or  ||
    not !

truth table for and &&

A      B     o/p
0  &&  1      0
1  &&  0      0
0  &&  0      0
1  &&  1      1

truth  table for or ||

A      B     o/pa
0  ||  1      1
1  ||  0      1
0  ||  0      0
1  ||  1      1

not !
A    o/p
1     0
0     1

4. increment/decrement operator

    pre-increment ++i
    post-increment i++
    pre-decrement --i
    post-decrement i++

5. Assigment Operators
   a = 1
   a += 1      a=a+1
